Touch events

touchstart
touchmove
touchend
touchcancel
touchenter
touchleave

If you do not want mouse events to be triggered use event.preventDefault().

The touch event has a number of properties.  The tutorial above is only interested in changedTouches.  This property contains a list of all the Touch objects that changed with the event.  There is also a property called touches which contains a full list of all the active touch points.

Each Touch object includes a number of properties that provide information about the position of the pointer on the screen.  For this tutorial we are only interested in identifier, pageX, and pageY.

identifier - A unique ID for the touch object.
pageX      - The position of the touch point which includes any scroll offset.
pageY      - The position of the touch point which includes any scroll offset.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch for more information on touch object properties.
